# Overview
KOLOMVERSE is a large-scale object detection dataset in the maritime domain. It has a total of 2,151,470 4K resolution images categorized into 5 different
classes namely ship (3,791,372 instances), buoy (67,048 instances), fishnet buoy (273,051 instances), lighthouse (103,358 instances) and wind farm (338,673 instances). The dataset is collected from 21 territotial waters of South Korea and is split in to train (1,729,601 images), validation (211,038 images) and test (210,831 images) sets.
